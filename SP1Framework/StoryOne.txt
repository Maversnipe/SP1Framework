Goldevice Town is a small village situated
     far in the corner of the Earth.

For it was populated with very little people, the
 village remained to be a peaceful hometown for
     all, until a severe illness struck.

Young Hero is now ready to embark on his journey to
 the Crystal Temple, where a rumoured cure was
        believed to be found there.
